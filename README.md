mod by pinterf

Differences to Masktools 2.0b1

- project moved to Visual Studio 2015 Update 3
  Requires VS2015 Update 3 redistributables
- Fix: mt_merge (and probably other multi-clip filters) may result in corrupted results 
  under specific circumstances, due to using video frame pointers which were already released from memory
- no special function names for high bit depth filters
- filters are auto registering their mt mode as MT_NICE_FILTER for Avisynth+
- Avisynth+ high bit depth support (incl. planar RGB, but color spaces with alpha plane are not yet supported)
  All filters are now supporting 10, 12, 14, 16 bits and float
  Note that parameters like threshold are not scaled automatically to the current bit depth
- YV411 (8 bit 4:1:1) support
- mt_merge accepts 4:2:2 clips when luma=true (8-16 bit)
- mt_merge accepts 4:1:1 clips when luma=true
- mt_merge to discard U and V automatically when input is greyscale
- some filters got AVX (float) and AVX2 (integer) support: mt_merge, mt_logic
- new: mt_lutxyza. Accepts four clips. 4th variable name is 'a' (besides x, y and z)
- expression syntax supporting bit depth independent expressions
  - bit-depth aware scale operators
  
      operator #B scales from 8 bit to current bit depth using bit-shifts
                  Use this for YUV. "235 #B" -> always results in max luma
                  
      operator #F scales from 8 bit to current bit depth using full range stretch
                  "255 #F" results in maximum pixel value of current bit depth.
                  Calculation: x/255*65535 for a 8->16 bit sample (rgb)
                  
  - hints for non-8 bit based constants: 
      Added configuration keywords i8, i10, i12, i14, i16 and f32 in order to tell the expression evaluator 
      the bit depth of the values that are to scale by #B and #F operators.
            
      By default #B and #F scales from 8 bit to the bit depth of the clip.
      
      i8 .. i16 and f32 sets the default conversion base to 8..16 bits or float, respectively.
      
      These keywords can appear anywhere in the expression, but only the last occurence will be effective for the whole expression.
      
      Examples 
```
      8 bit video, no modifier: "x y - 256 #B *" evaluates as "x y - 256 *"
      10 bit video, no modifier: "x y - 256 #B *" evaluates as "x y - 1024 *"
      10 bit video: "i16 x y - 65536 #B *" evaluates as "x y - 1024 *"
      8 bit video: "i10 x y - 512 #B *" evaluates as "x y - 128 *"                  
```

  - new pre-defined, bit depth aware constants
  
    - bitdepth: automatic silent parameter of the lut expression      
    - range_half --> autoscaled 128 or 0.5 for float
    - range_max --> 255/1023/4095/16383/65535 or 1.0 for float
    - range_size --> 256/1024...65536
    - ymin, ymax, cmin, cmax --> 16/235 and 16/240 autoscaled.
      
Example #1 (bit depth dependent, all constants are treated as-is): 
```
      expr8_luma = "x 16 - 219 / 255 *"
      expr10_luma = "x 64 - 876 / 1023 *"
      expr16_luma = "x 4096 - 56064 / 65535 *"
```
      
Example #2 (new, with auto-scale operators )      
```
      expr_luma =  "x 16 #B - 219 #B / 255 #F *"
      expr_chroma =  "x 16 #B - 224 #B / 255 #F *"
```
      
Example #3 (new, with constants)
```
      expr_luma = "x ymin - ymax ymin - / range_max *"
      expr_chroma = "x cmin - cmax cmin - / range_max *"
```
- parameter "stacked" (default false) for filters with stacked format support
  Stacked support is not intentional, but since tp7 did it, I did not remove the feature.
  Filters currently without stacked support will never have it. 
- parameter "realtime" for lut-type filters, slower but at least works on those bit depths
  where LUT tables would occupy too much memory.
  For bit depth limits where realtime = true is set as the default working mode, see table below.
    
  realtime=true can be overridden, one can experiment and force realtime=false even for a 16 bit lutxy 
  (8GBytes lut table!, x64 only) or for 8 bit lutxzya (4GBytes lut table)

Changelog
**v2.2.3 (2017022?)**
- mt_logic to 32 bit float (final filter lacking it)
- get CpuInfo from Avisynth (avx/avx2 preparation)
  Note: AVX/AVX2 works if 
  - recent Avisynth+ that reports extra CPU flags
  - 64 bit OS (but Avisynth can be 32 bits)
  - Windows 7 SP1 or newer
- mt_merge: 8-16 bit: AVX2, float:AVX
_ mt_logic: 8-16 bit: AVX2, float:AVX

- mt_lutxyza 4D lut available with realtime=false! (4 GBytes LUT table, slower initial lut table calculation)
  Allowed only on x64. When is it worth?
  Number of expression evaluations for 4G lut calculation equals to realtime calculation on 
  2100 frames (1920x1080 plane). Be warned, it would take be minutes.
- mt_gradient 10-16 bit / float
- mt_convolution 10-16 bit / float

- Expression syntax supporting bit depth independent expressions: 
  Added configuration keywords i8, i10, i12, i14, i16 and f32 in order to inform the expression evaluator 
  about bit depth of the values that are to scale by #B and #F operators.
